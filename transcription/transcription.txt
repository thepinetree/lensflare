but this weekend I think we've seen that that Disney is is prepared to be very price competitive with Netflix they started by pricing their base line service at 699 which is substantially below or Netflix was on their earnings call 3 weeks ago or 4 weeks ago they announced this bundle where they're going to be bundling Hulu ESPN and Disney Plus for $13 which again is very price competitive with the with the Met Netflix service and then as as you mentioned earlier they're going to give consumers for streams right which is the premium Netflix subscription as well as for K part of the attraction of this business model for investors in Disney is that it provides that sticky you subscriber base model that you're looking for earnings predictability and smoothing things out and so forth but do they have to have to be profitable for Disney at Sam's right now at some point that they're not going to be profitable until 2024 they expect to have something between 60 and 90 million subscribersare they came out so so that the service itself is going to be profitable even even based on their estimate until 2024 that being said subscription streaming services have subscription-based Revenue with recurring Revenue which law school books on very very well and of course any any business with streaming because of the growth associated with right now that's a huge premium in the market and we saw the fact that on there when they announced Disney plus they essentially cut their earnings by 1/3 and they said they were going to make money on the product for for 5 years which tells you how many services today this weekend we are reminded that in my view I mean is the one new streaming service that has already established franchise is it going to be able to take advantage of with the new programming that they're going to do something that the Netflix has had to develop on its own an apple is starting from Square Oneexactly that's exactly right Belle Disney is all about the power of his brand we're seeing them introduced these huge new titles like Star Wars that are going to be exclusively in their Mandalorian show me exclusively on the service of your big fan of the movies that's going to drive you back to the streaming service same thing with all of their other big franchises like Marvel if you want to be able to watch a Marvel movie you can't watch it on Netflix anymore so the fact that they're pulling their content from Netflix they're putting it on their own platform is all about the strength of the Disney brand and pay attention to how they're doing this across different platforms really interesting cuz they really use the park and the studio to feed into the demand for the streaming service so is there cross-platform here leveraging that really unique intellectual property and will be interesting to see what happens to Netflix Netflix has a lot of content but doesn't have those distinctive brands in the same way that Disney. I mean it sounds like when I hear it can't missthen I start getting sweaty Palms is there anything that worries about the Disney plus five look from from the outside is going to be a very attractive consumer proposition what should give investors pause is how competitive the landscape is Netflix is going to spend 14 15 billion dollars this year in content Amazon close behind behind at 10 you have HBO out there Showtime Anytime CBS all access so it's just going to be a very very competitive Marketplace for the streaming subscriber and unlike traditional cable bundles we're often times you sign up for a two-year contract it's very easy to move in and out of different streaming services and there's a lot of flexibility to choose from whoever's got the lowest price right now and investors aren't in love with that business model
