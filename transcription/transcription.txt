Brad what more can you tell us call Jay The Saga That Never Ends has reached something of an inch at least for now in Oakland with the Raiders officially releasing Antonio Brown as she requested be done early this morning they're really after the Raiders find him over $215,000 told them that he would not be entitled to any termination pay in a separate letter and basically avoided his guarantees so I would imagine that they're over the 29.125 million dollars that was remaining on his contract and guaranteed money the Raiders and Antonio Brown might not be done doing business yet as they have I go over that money that large sum of money and now Antonio Brown becomes a free agent free to sign with another team and what is transpired over the course of the last week certainly is not going to help them get these type of contract that he was looking for it'll be and when how many teams are interested in him I would assume that the union will file an expedited grievance on his better half and the story that basically has come to something when I'm in Oakland continues in a different way with Antonio free with everything happening right now that is continued to happen also more together he goes he gets frostbite on his speech he shows up to training camp in a hot air balloon doesn't attend meetings Kohl's at the team and finding him challenges with curses out of the general manager post a video of a conversation a private conversation have a Jon Gruden last night to manage his release and ultimately gets his release and Antonio Brown's chat with the Raiders won the most bizarre chapters that is ever involved with any player on any team at any point in the history of football has now come to something of an end you've been covering the story at what point did this start to go wrong when you realized this might not end well when the Raiders trade for him and there was not a lot of interest in him around the league in Pittsburgh was going to trade arguably the most productive wide receiver Noles football for a 3rd round draft pick while eating 21 million dollars to get thrown salary cap it was important enough for Pittsburgh to have 21 million dollars count against their cap this year to tree is not a sign that something is wrong that's assigned to me greatly the Raiders didn't see that they thought what made them think they can handle it basically and they thought they were getting a bargain on Antonio Brown for a 3rd and 5th round pick and everybody always thinks that they're going to be the one that controls the guy but I think that we seen his kind of become more more outrageous overtime and more more unique and more more oh how do we say this and so basically now we have a situation where this drama has unfolded in a crazy way what's the market for Antonio Brown right now let's go back to when the Raiders were shopping and find the Steelers are shop again it was not exactly robust now at that point in time there were a couple of teams had to be compensated couple parties, see the Steelers and Antonio Brown but I would say this to you do you think that there's a team out there that's going to be more willing or less willing to give him guaranteed money then if it's time that the Steelers are trading him everyone thank you for watching ESPN on YouTube for more Sports more analysis download the ESPN app and for live streaming Sports and premium content subscribe to ESPN plus we'll see you there
